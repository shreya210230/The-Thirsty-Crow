        <h1>The Thirsty Crow</h1>
        <p>A crow was flying in search of water on a hot summer afternoon.He couldn't find a single drop.
            Thirsty and tired, the crow sat on a branch of a banyan tree.
            Suddenly, he saw a pitcher on the other side of the tree.
            Delighted, the crow flew to the pitcher and saw there was
            some water in it. "Finally, I can quench my thirst," he thought.
            The crow puthis beak into the pitcher but the water
            level was low, so he couldn't drink it. He sat there,
            looking around, and saw some pebbles on the ground.
            He had a brilliant idea.
            The crow picked up a pebble and dropped it into the pitcher.
            The water level rose slightly.
            He dropped more pebbles, one by one,into the pitcher until the water level was high enough for him to drink.
            The smart crow quenched his thirst and flew away. THE END!!</p>
